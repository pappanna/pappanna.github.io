Welcome! I am an environmental economist working on applied microeconomic and interdisciplinary research related to climate change, climate adaptation, and plastic pollution. I use remote sensing and non-traditional data in a lot of my projects.

I will join the Bren School at UC Santa Barbara as an Assistant Professor in July 2026, following a one-year postdoc at MIT (Dept. of Economics). 

I got my PhD in [Sustainable Development](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development) at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs.
