Welcome! I am a PhD student in the [Sustainable Development](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development) program at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs.
 
I am an environmental economist working on applied microeconomic and interdisciplinary research. I am particularly interested in ***climate adaptation*** and ***plastic pollution***. I use remote sensing and non-traditional data in a lot of my projects.
 
I graduated from Harvard University, where I studied Environmental Engineering and Computer Science. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a research assistant at Yale School of Management and as an equity research associate at AB Bernstein.
