Welcome! I am a PhD student in the [Sustainable Development](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development) program at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs.
 
I am an environmental economist with interests in labor economics. I work on applied microeconomic and interdisciplinary research related to climate change, climate adaptation, and plastic pollution. I use remote sensing and non-traditional data in a lot of my projects.
 
I graduated from Harvard University, where I studied Environmental Engineering and Computer Science. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a research assistant at Yale School of Management and as an equity research associate at AB Bernstein. 

I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market.
