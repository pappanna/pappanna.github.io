**Code:** To work through (some of) the new two-way fixed effects/dynamic diff-in-diff methods, my grad school colleague [Vincent Bagilet](https://vincentbagilet.github.io/) and I have put together set of simulations, example datasets, and code (as part of Jeffrey Shrader's lab), which you can find [here](https://github.com/pappanna/twfe).

**Non-academic interests:** I grew up in Budapest, Hungary. In my free time I enjoy hiking, camping, packrafting (check out my trip reports [here](https://www.grousingaround.com/)), vegan food, and my favorite [boardgame](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12333/twilight-struggle).

**Website:** This website design is based on Gautam Raoâ€™s [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gautamrao/gautamrao.github.io). Thank you for making it public! Images: Blackstone Bay from Vista Hike; View from Matanuska Peak; Denali from Kesugi Ridge (on a very clear day!); Archangel Valley.
