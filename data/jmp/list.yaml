- title: "Who bears climate change damages? Evidence from the gig economy"
  book: "Job Market Paper (Draft Coming Soon!)"
  abstract: > 
      This paper provides the first causal evidence that gig economy platforms enable consumer adaptation to climate change while shifting climate-related damages to workers without incremental compensation. Across diverse markets and climates (UK, Germany, France, and Mexico), I leverage detailed transaction data and labor force surveys and exploit exogenous variation in daily maximum temperatures. On hot days relative to moderate days, I find an 8-16% increase in food delivery expenditures and a similar decline in dine-in restaurant spending, driven primarily by higher-income consumers. On these days, food delivery workers work 1.7 hours more on average, exposing them to material health risks. Yet, I find that their hourly wages do not increase, despite the flexibility of wages in this setting. This combination of results is unique to platform-based work and I provide evidence that future earnings uncertainty related to workers' employment status plays a role in these outcomes. My findings highlight environmental equity concerns from unequal access to climate adaptation and the shift of climate harms and underscore the importance of climate-related risks in regulating gig economy platform work.
