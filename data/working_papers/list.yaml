    Plastic pollution poses threats to marine ecosystems and ecosystem services. While plastic bag bans and taxes are increasingly implemented worldwide, their effectiveness in reducing plastic litter remains unknown. Leveraging the patchwork of bag policies across different geographic scales in the United States and citizen science data on 45,067 U.S. shoreline cleanups, we assess the impact of these policies on plastic bag litter. We find that plastic bag policies lead to a 25-47% decrease in plastic bags as a share of total items collected at cleanups, with taxes possibly further reducing shoreline litter. At a time when many jurisdictions are considering bag policies while others are preemptively prohibiting them, our study provides evidence that these policies can reduce shoreline plastic pollution.

      Human actions can alter the regional climate, particularly via land use. We analyze the Great Plains Shelterbelt, a large-scale forestation program in the 1930s across the US Midwest. This program led to a decades-long increase in precipitation and decrease in temperature. Changes extended to adjacent unforested land up to 200km away - enabling us to directly study climate adaptation. In downwind places facing improved growing conditions, farmers expanded corn acreage and switched to more water-intensive production. This paper highlights the endogeneity of the climate to land use changes, and the potential for tree planting to regionally mitigate climate change impacts.
