      Human actions can alter the regional climate, particularly via land use. We analyze the Great Plains Shelterbelt, a large-scale forestation program in the 1930s across the US Midwest. This program led to a decades-long increase in precipitation and decrease in temperature. Changes extended to adjacent unforested land up to 200km away - enabling us to directly study climate adaptation. In downwind places facing improved growing conditions, farmers expanded corn acreage and switched to more water-intensive production. This paper highlights the endogeneity of the climate to land use changes, and the potential for tree planting to regionally mitigate climate change impacts.

- title: "Are plastic bag regulations effective in reducing plastic litter? Evidence from shoreline cleanups"

    As the dangers of plastic debris to marine animals and its adverse impacts on ecosystem services are now well-documented, reducing mismanaged plastic waste has become a policy priority in countries around the world. In the United States, single-use bag bans and charges are growing in popularity; we estimate approximately a third of Americans now live in areas with bag restrictions. While previous studies have focused on how these policies affect consumption of plastic and other bag types, their ultimate impact on marine litter is harder to measure and thus remains unknown. Using citizen science data on 97,774 U.S. shoreline cleanups, and exploiting differences in the timing and geographic scope of U.S. bag policies, we find that bag policies lead to a 22-25% decrease in plastic bags as a share of total items collected at cleanups. Both state- and county-level policies are effective in reducing plastic bag litter in the environment, while town-level policies are not. At a time when some jurisdictions are considering implementing bag policies while others are preemptively prohibiting such regulations, our study provides large-scale evidence on the effectiveness of both command-and-control and market-based policies in reducing plastic pollution.
