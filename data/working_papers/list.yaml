  abstract: >
      Human actions can alter the regional climate, particularly via land use. We analyze the Great Plains Shelterbelt, a large-scale forestation program in the 1930s across the US Midwest. This program led to a decades-long increase in precipitation and decrease in temperature. Changes extended to adjacent unforested land up to 200km away - enabling us to directly study climate adaptation. In downwind places facing improved growing conditions, farmers expanded corn acreage and switched to more water-intensive production. This paper highlights the endogeneity of the climate to land use changes, and the potential for tree planting to regionally mitigate climate change impacts.

  abstract: > 
      This paper provides the first causal evidence that gig economy platforms enable consumer adaptation to climate change while shifting climate-related damages to workers. Across diverse markets and climates (UK, Germany, France, and Mexico), I leverage detailed transaction data and labor force surveys and exploit exogenous variation in daily maximum temperatures. On hot days relative to moderate days, I find an 8-16% increase in food delivery expenditures and a similar decline in dine-in restaurant spending, driven primarily by higher-income consumers. On these days, food delivery workers work 1.7 hours more on average, exposing them to material health risks. Yet, I find that their hourly wages do not increase, despite the flexibility of wages in this setting. This response to heat is unique to platform-based work. I show that worker beliefs are the main mechanism: platform workers believe that declining tasks - particularly during periods of peak demand such as hot days - deprioritizes them for future work. My findings raise broader questions about algorithmic fairness and highlight environmental equity concerns from unequal access to climate adaptation.
