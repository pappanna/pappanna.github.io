      Human actions can alter the regional climate, particularly via land use. We analyze the Great Plains Shelterbelt, a large-scale forestation program in the 1930s across the US Midwest. This program led to a decades-long increase in precipitation and decrease in temperature. Changes extended to adjacent unforested land up to 200km away - enabling us to directly study climate adaptation. In downwind places facing improved growing conditions, farmers expanded corn acreage and switched to more water-intensive production. This paper highlights the endogeneity of the climate to land use changes, and the potential for tree planting to regionally mitigate climate change impacts.

      We investigate how occupation influences the relationship between temperature and mortality in Mexico. Using multiple decades of nationwide death records---which include information on occupation---linked to local weather data, we find that heat-related mortality risk varies sharply by occupation. Young adults in climate-exposed jobs, especially in agriculture, experience significantly higher death rates from warm and hot temperatures. A 15 to 24 year-old agricultural worker is over 10 times more likely to die from heat exposure than a peer in professional or managerial employment, underscoring the role of occupation in climate vulnerability. These findings evince that the burden of extreme heat disproportionately falls on the working poor. Our results suggest that implementing occupational safety measures and targeted heat adaptation policies (such as mandatory rest breaks and early warnings for outdoor workers) are essential to protect vulnerable workers. Furthermore, ongoing economic shifts away from highly exposed sectors may reduce increases in heat-related mortality due to climate change.

  pdflink: "/jmp/apapp_jmp.pdf"
  abstract: > 
      This paper provides the first causal evidence that gig economy platforms enable consumer adaptation to climate change while shifting climate-related damages to workers. Across diverse markets and climates (UK, Germany, France, and Mexico), I leverage detailed transaction data and labor force surveys and exploit exogenous variation in daily maximum temperatures. On hot days relative to moderate days, I find an 8-16% increase in food delivery expenditures and a similar decline in dine-in restaurant spending, driven primarily by higher-income consumers. On these days, food delivery workers work 1.7 hours more on average, exposing them to material health risks. Yet, I find that their hourly wages do not increase, despite the flexibility of wages in this setting. This response to heat is unique to platform-based work. I show that worker beliefs are the main mechanism: platform workers believe that declining tasks - particularly during periods of peak demand such as hot days - deprioritizes them for future work. My findings raise broader questions about algorithmic fairness and highlight environmental equity concerns from unequal access to climate adaptation.
