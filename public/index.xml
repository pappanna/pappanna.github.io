      <description>Welcome! I am a PhD student in the Sustainable Development program at Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s School of International and Public Affairs.
I conduct applied micro and interdisciplinary research with a focus on the environment. I am particularly interested in climate and environmental adaptation and plastic pollution. I use remote sensing and non-traditional data in a lot of my projects.
I graduated from Harvard University, where I studied Environmental Engineering and Computer Science.</description>

      <description>Code: To work through (some of) the new two-way fixed effects/dynamic diff-in-diff methods, my grad school colleague Vincent Bagilet and I have put together set of simulations, example datasets, and code (as part of Jeffrey Shrader&amp;rsquo;s lab), which you can find here.
Non-academic interests: I grew up in Budapest, Hungary. In my free time I enjoy hiking, camping, packrafting (check out my trip reports here), vegan food, and my favorite boardgame.</description>
