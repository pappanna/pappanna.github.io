      Human actions can alter the regional climate, particularly via land use. We analyze the Great Plains Shelterbelt, a large-scale forestation program in the 1930s across the US Midwest. This program led to a decades-long increase in precipitation and decrease in temperature. Changes extended to adjacent unforested land up to 200km away - enabling us to directly study climate adaptation. In downwind places facing better growing conditions, crop yields increased 11-22%, and farmers switched to more water-intensive production. Regional climate is endogenous to land use policy, with implications for the study of climate change impacts and mitigation.
