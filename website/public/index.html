    <h2 id="bio">About</h2>

<p>Welcome! I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development">Sustainable Development</a> program at Columbia University&rsquo;s School of International and Public Affairs.</p>
<p>I conduct applied micro and interdisciplinary research with a focus on the environment. I am particularly interested in <em><strong>climate and environmental adaptation</strong></em> and <em><strong>plastic pollution</strong></em>. I use remote sensing and non-traditional data in a lot of my projects.</p>
<p>I graduated from Harvard University, where I studied Environmental Engineering and Computer Science. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a research assistant at Yale School of Management and as an equity research associate at AB Bernstein.</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Douglas Almond, Shuang Zhang)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Journal of Public Economics, 2023</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(0)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_0"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_0" style="display:none;">: Environmental externalities from cryptomining may be large, but have not been linked causally to mining incentives. We exploit daily variation in Bitcoin price as a natural experiment for an 86 megawatt waste coal-fired power plant with on-site cryptomining. We find that carbon emissions respond swiftly to mining incentives, with price elasticities of 0.69–0.71 in the short-run and 0.33–0.40 in the longer run. A $1 increase in Bitcoin price leads to $3.11–$6.79 in external damages from carbon emissions alone, well exceeding cryptomining’s value added (using a $190 social cost of carbon, but ignoring increased local air pollution). As cryptomining requires ever more computing power to mine a given number of blocks, our study highlights both the revitalization of US fossil assets and the need for financial industry accounting to incorporate cryptomining externalities.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Douglas Almond, Xinming Du)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Nature Climate Change, 2022</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(1)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_1"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_1" style="display:none;">: Methane is 28 to 86 times more potent as a driver of global warming than CO2. Global methane concentrations have increased at an accelerating rate since 2004, yet the role of fossil fuels and revitalized natural gas extraction and distribution in accelerating methane concentrations is poorly recognized. Here we examine the policy positioning of university-based energy centres towards natural gas, given their growing influence on climate discourse. We conducted sentiment analysis using a lexicon- and rule-based sentiment scoring tool on 1,168,194 sentences in 1,706 reports from 26 universities, some of which receive their primary funding from the natural gas industry. We found that fossil-funded centres are more favourable in their reports towards natural gas than towards renewable energy, and tweets are more favourable when they mention funders by name. Centres less dependent on fossil funding show a reversed pattern with more neutral sentiment towards gas, and favour solar and hydro power.</span></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Florian Grosset, Charles Taylor)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Working Paper, May 2023</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(2)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_2"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_2" style="display:none;">: Human actions can alter the regional climate, particularly via land use. We analyze the Great Plains Shelterbelt, a large-scale forestation program in the 1930s across the US Midwest. This program led to a decades-long increase in precipitation and decrease in temperature. Changes extended to adjacent unforested land up to 200km away - enabling us to directly study climate adaptation. In downwind places facing better growing conditions, crop yields increased 11-22%, and farmers switched to more water-intensive production. Regional climate is endogenous to land use policy, with implications for the study of climate change impacts and mitigation.</span></p>

<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px;">Pollution, plastics, and the global trade in garbage</h3>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Matthew Gordon)</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Funding: STEG Initiative at CEPR, Minderoo Foundation</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(4)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_4"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_4" style="display:none;">: What are the impacts of the global trade in plastic waste? Since a 1991 World Bank memo argued, “the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable” cross country flows of plastic waste have increased seven-fold. Yet the consequences of this trade are poorly understood, partially due to the lack of basic descriptive data about what happens to exported waste at its many destinations. Using satellite data and a machine-learning algorithm trained on crowd-sourced data, we study the spread of informal dumps before and after a major shock to the global trade in waste. Our preliminary findings show that the dumps create severe externalities, while the benefits to jobs and wages appear modest.

<p><strong>Code:</strong> To work through (some of) the new two-way fixed effects/dynamic diff-in-diff methods, my grad school colleague <a href="https://vincentbagilet.github.io/">Vincent Bagilet</a> and I have put together set of simulations, example datasets, and code (as part of Jeffrey Shrader&rsquo;s lab), which you can find <a href="https://github.com/pappanna/twfe">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Non-academic interests:</strong> I grew up in Budapest, Hungary. In my free time I enjoy hiking, camping, packrafting (check out my trip reports <a href="https://www.grousingaround.com/">here</a>), vegan food, and my favorite <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12333/twilight-struggle">boardgame</a>.</p>
